                    <h1>Care Instructions</h1>
                    <p>Beach Bunny suits are constructed of the finest imported fabrics and trims that are extremely delicate in nature. Many of the suits are similar to fine lingerie and must be cared for in the same manner. While ALL of the suits can be worn in pool or ocean water, they are not intended for strenuous physical water activity or long periods of time in heavily chlorinated water.</p>
                    <p>All swimwear should be hand washed in cold water with very mild soap (such as specialty lingerie detergent). Lie flat or hang to dry. <span class="highlihgt">DO NOT USE WOOLITE!</span></p>
