                    <h1>TOPS</h1>

                    <h6>TRIANGLE, HALTER, BANDEAU SIZE CONVERSIONS</h6>

                    <h6>SPECIALTY STYLES: PLUNGE, BALCONET, PUSH UP SIZE CONVERSIONS</h6>
                    <h2 class="subheading">PLUNGE</h2>
                    <p>The Beach Bunny Plunge cup sculpts and shows off cleavage with a low center front and cut away cups. Great for the customer that wants the push up effect of cleavage and lift but does not desire the extra padding. This style offers good support.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">BALCONET <span>with removable straps</span></h2>
                    <p>The Beach Bunny Balconet cup is sexy with a low, square neckline and wide placed straps. Cups are shaped with seams to lift the cleavage like a corset or shelf bra. Removable straps allow the option of wearing this style strapless. This style offers the least amount of cleavage and lift.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">PUSH UP </h2>
                    <p>The Classic Beach Bunny Push Up cup creates an uplifted cleavage with foam padding. The plunge shaped cup allows for maximum cleavage and sexiness and padding adds as much as a whole cup size to your bust. This style offers maximum cleavage. <br/>If you're not used to this style, a larger cup size may feel more comfortable.</p>

                    <h1>BOTTOMS</h1>
            
                    <h6 class="subheading">TIE SIDE, LACEWAIST, SHIRRED, JEWELED SIZE CONVERSIONS</h6>

                    <img src="">

                    <p>Beach Bunny tops and bottoms are all self lined. Tops fit true to size. Bottoms are cut narrow in the back. There are no thong bottoms in the collection nor are there any "full coverage" bottoms offered. They are "Brazilian" style, which means low cut in front and narrow in back. Bottoms with the stretch lace waistband tend to work the best with various body types and the lace does not dig.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of these suits have been tested and are safe to wear in both salt water and chlorine. Embellishments such as the chains and metals have also been tested and safe to wear in the sun. To clean your swimwear, we suggest using Beach Bunny Swimwear Cleaner.</p>
